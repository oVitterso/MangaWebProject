        The inspiration for this site was created from Olves desire to enjoy Manga content in a good way, experience the development challenges that follows, aswell as create a better understanding of what makes a good manga viewing/exploration website.
        However, the industry has a issue, with scraping sites, and un authorised translations and uploads.Especially in the west and Europe, where the book form is expensive, and online options are not availiable. 
        To combat this, accesible options needs to be introduced in an effort to reduce this. In a study conducted in australia on 11.000 participents, 70% replied that they turned to piracy and torrent sites due to the content was not availiablei in their region.
